excerpt: "\"Oh! Hi Mark!\""

There's something about getting into a pair of comfortable pajamas, throwing on a t-shirt and a hoodie, propping my feet up on the coffee table, turning on the television and working on some random bits of code—a game prototype that's rushing toward design, learning AIR by writing development tools, or messing around with some new-fangled web technology that all the cool hackers are talking about—that just puts me in a good mood and really improves my creativity. It's those nights when I just know that I'll have completely squashed these bugs with just *one* more build. Of course, it rarely ever happens. I don't mind, because I know that it'll take just _one_ more build.

I am a developer. I make video games. It's a pleasure to meet you.
