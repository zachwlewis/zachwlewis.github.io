After reading the excelent [Saw It For You: Star Wars: The Force Awakens Teaser Trailer (2014)](http://chainsawsuit.com/2014/11/28/saw-it-for-you-star-wars-the-force-awakens-teaser-trailer-2014/) by [Kris Straub](https://twitter.com/krisstraub), I was faced with severe disappointment when the web address in one of his throwaway gags didn't resolve. After a few minutes of frowning at my browser, I decided to do something about it.

The something that I did do was buy the domain and build the site so everyone can experience the joy of discovering the saberbody color unique to them. If, for some reason, you don't know your saberbody color, you don't have an excuse anymore.

_[http://whatsmysaberbodycolor.com](http://whatsmysaberbodycolor.com) was built on GitHub pages using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap) in an afternoon. The longest part of the process was writing the descriptions of the different saberbodies. The shortest part was deciding to do it._
