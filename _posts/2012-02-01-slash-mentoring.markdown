excerpt: "Would you like to be my mentee?"

I would like everyone to know that I participating in the [/mentoring](http://mentoring.is/) movement that was started by [Diana Kimball](http://dianakimball.com/). The basic gist of the movement is that I provide a link to a page (a "/mentoring" page, if you will) that describes my life experiences and encourages people who would like to learn from me to do so. I promise to respond to all of you folks, so feel free to [read over my experiences](/mentoring) and flood my inbox.
