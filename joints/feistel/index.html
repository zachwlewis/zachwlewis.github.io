      <h1>Feistel Cipher</h1>
      <p>
        A Feistel cipher is a symmetric structure used in the construction of
        block ciphers, named after the German-born physicist and cryptographer
        Horst Feistel. It is a design model from which many different block
        ciphers are derived. Feistel ciphers are widely used in cryptographic
        algorithms due to their simplicity and effectiveness.

        The Feistel structure consists of multiple rounds of processing of the
        plaintext, where each round applies a substitution and permutation to
        the data. The input is split into two halves, and in each round, one
        half is modified using a round function and then combined with the other
        half. This process is repeated for a number of rounds, typically between
        16 and 32, depending on the specific algorithm.

        One of the key advantages of Feistel ciphers is that they can be easily
        inverted, allowing for both encryption and decryption using the same
        algorithm. This is achieved by reversing the order of the round keys
        during decryption. Examples of well-known Feistel ciphers include the
        Data Encryption Standard (DES) and the Blowfish algorithm.
