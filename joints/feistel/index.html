      <h1>Feistel Cipher</h1>
      <p>
        As a video game UI engineer, I'm always looking for ways to add
        complexity to things that don't need it. My current fixation is this
        little piece of text in the bottom corner of the game.
      </p>

      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <pre id="build-number">Build: <span class="value-as-number">69420</span></pre>

      <p>
        I mean, it's <em>fine</em>. It clearly shows the current build number,
        which is extremely useful for developers and QA. My biggest issue is
        that <strong>it's basic</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Numbers are boring. Sequential numbers are even more boring. What if,
        instead of clearly understandable <em>numbers</em>, we add a bit of
        flavor and obfuscate the useful information with additional steps?
      </p>

      <pre class="value-as-words"></pre>

      <p>Well now, <em>that's</em> something worth exploring.</p>

      <h2>Initial Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        As an incredible engineer, it's important to enforce process early.
        Before we do anything <em>fun</em>, let's put together a user story with
        some proper conditions of satisfaction.
      </p>

      <section class="sans-card">
        <p>
          As a user, I want a <strong>reversible</strong> operation that
          converts a build number into a unique string.
        </p>

        <h3>Conditions of Satisfaction</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The operation should produce a human-readable string</li>
          <li>Every unique build number should produce a unique string</li>
          <li>
            For any unique build number, the operation should always produce the
            same unique string
          </li>
          <li>
            Reversing the operation should result in the original build number
          </li>
        </ol>

        A Feistel cipher is a symmetric structure used in the construction of
        block ciphers, named after the German-born physicist and cryptographer
        Horst Feistel. It is a design model from which many different block
        ciphers are derived. Feistel ciphers are widely used in cryptographic
        algorithms due to their simplicity and effectiveness.

      <input type="number" name="value" id="value" value="69420" />
      <input
        type="range"
        name="value_range"
        id="value_range"
        value="69420"
        min="0"
        max="4294967296"
      />
      <ol id="outputs"></ol>
      <p>
        The Feistel structure consists of multiple rounds of processing of the
        plaintext, where each round applies a substitution and permutation to
        the data. The input is split into two halves, and in each round, one
        half is modified using a round function and then combined with the other
        half. This process is repeated for a number of rounds, typically between
        16 and 32, depending on the specific algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the key advantages of Feistel ciphers is that they can be easily
        inverted, allowing for both encryption and decryption using the same
        algorithm. This is achieved by reversing the order of the round keys
        during decryption. Examples of well-known Feistel ciphers include the
        Data Encryption Standard (DES) and the Blowfish algorithm.
