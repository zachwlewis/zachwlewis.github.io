Every major step forward in my life so far has been inspired and encouraged by the mentors I’ve been fortunate enough to have. I believe that hopes, dreams, and advice are best shared in ongoing, personal relationships, and it’s important to me to make myself available as a mentor to others.

I’ve had so many great experiences in my life, and I’d love to share them if you’re considering pursuing a similar path

* I started [_The Game Studio_](http://www.thegamestudio.net "The Game Studio"), a small game development studio, in 2010
* I led a small team of developers and won the [_Games Inspired By Music: Game Development Competition_](http://www.boingboing.net/2010/07/16/boing-boing-game-dev.html) with our game [_Space Junk_](http://www.kongregate.com/games/zachwlewis/space-junk?sfa=permalink&referrer=zachwlewis)
* I've created independent video games, mostly for fun, in as many frameworks as I can get my hands on, including:
	* [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) (in Lua)
	* [FlashPunk](http://flashpunk.net/) (in ActionScript 3)
	* [XNA](http://create.msdn.com/en-US/) (in C#)
	* [Unity](http://unity3d.com/)
	* [Unreal Engine 3](http://www.unrealengine.com/)
* I've worked in "the industry" using industry-standard tools for traditional game development every day, including:
	* [Unreal Engine 3](http://www.unrealengine.com/)
	* [Autodesk Scaleform](http://gameware.autodesk.com/scaleform) (it was privately owned by when I started)
	* [Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Flash](http://www.adobe.com/)
* I earned a BS in Computer Engineering in 2008 and an MS in Software Engineering in 2010
* I've been a government employee (eight years and counting!) and learned to love it

If you’d like to work together, you can write me a letter responding to the questions below; I’ll write back to all letters I receive in this way within a fortnight, no matter what. In response to the most exceptional letters, I’ll propose further correspondence—and in certain cases, an ongoing mentoring relationship.

1. Tell me about yourself. How did you become who you are, and who do you want to become?
2. What do you hope to gain from our mentoring relationship?
3. What’s the best thing you’ve read, watched, or listened to lately?

Add links to any profiles or projects you’re proud of, and send it all to: <mentoring@zacharylew.is>.

I look forward to learning together!
