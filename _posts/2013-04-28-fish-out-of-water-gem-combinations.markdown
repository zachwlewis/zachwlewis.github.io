After quite a bit of searching, I wasn't able to find a single guide that just listed the combinations of gems that comprise the ten charms available in Halfbrick's new fish-skipping iOS game, _Fish Out Of Water_; however, I did find a YouTube video with some dope house beats that, after muting, served me well enough to create this list.

## About Gems And Charms
In _Fish Out Of Water_, whenever you level up, you're awarded a random collection of gems which, when combined, create unique charms that help you during your current run. The order of gems combined does not matter, so use what you have to get the highest score possible.

## The List

__Red Charm__ Adds 75 meters to your next throw! __Combine__ two red gems.

![Yellow Charm](/post-media/fish-out-of-water-charms/yellow.png)
__Yellow Charm__ Adds 3 boosties to your boost bar! __Combine__ two yellow gems.

![Blue Charm](/post-media/fish-out-of-water-charms/blue.png)
__Blue Charm__ Adds 20 skips to your next throw! __Combine__ two blue gems.

![Black Charm](/post-media/fish-out-of-water-charms/black.png)
__Black Charm__ Use the special black charm as your next throw! __Combine__ two black gems. When thrown, this cool gem splits into three fish that swim like Finlay.

I hope this list helps! If you'd like to fling fish with me, I'm swimming around in the "game developers" league!
